# Responsive Navbar

![A screen recording of the navigation bar in action](assets/screenshot.gif)

This is a very simple and responsive navigation bar. When the user's screen window is less than or equal to 850px, the navigation links will disappear and will be replaced with the typical hamburger menu. When a user clicks on the hamburger menu, the black background will fill the entire screen and the links will reappear.
